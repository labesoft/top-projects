# [Alarm Clock with GUI](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-project-ideas)
It is no doubt that an alarm clock is always handy to alert us whenever we 
sleep, take a short nap, or to remind us about the work, we always get 
oblivious about.

Our ancestors have been using an alarm, going back to its 2,000 years long
history but over time, the new advancements in technologies allow us to keep
an alarm clock without it containing a dial, gear trains, etc. How? Let's find
out further.

## About the project
he objective of this project is to recreate an alarm that a user could set
interactively and which will ring back at this preset time.

## Prerequisite
This project requires good knowledge of Python and GUI (Graphic User Interface). 
Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI
applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk
GUI toolkit. All  the modules used need not be downloaded beforehand like the
other libreries like NumPy, thus this project will be user friendly and
accessible in any virtual environment used for python programming.

## Project Plan
First, let's check the steps to build an Alarm Clock program in Python:

1. Importing all the libraries and modules required
1. Putting forward the code that takes a time input, the user wants to set the
alarm on and automatically ring a sound when the time is up
1. Create a display window for user input
