# [Rock Paper Scissor Game](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-rock-paper-scissors-game/)

Rock paper scissors game is also known as stone paper scissors. It is a hand 
game that is usually played between 2 people, each player can randomly form 
any one of three from their hand.

A player who chooses rock will win by another player who chooses scissors 
but loose by the player who chooses paper; a player with paper will loose by 
the player with the scissors.

If both players choose the same then the game is tied. Rock paper scissors 
game is mainly played among kids.

## About the project

The object of the rock-paper-scissor python project is to build a game for a 
single player that plays with a computer, anywhere, and anytime. This 
project is base on the rules that:

    rock blunts scissors so rock wins
    scissors cut the paper so scissors win
    paper cover rock so paper wins

This project is build using tkinter, random modules, and the basic concept 
of python.

In this python project, players have to choose any one from rock, paper, and 
scissors. Then click on the play button will show the result of the game.

## Prerequisite

To implement this python rock paper scissors project we will use the basic 
concept of python with tkinter and random module.

    Tkinter is a standard GUI library which is one of the easiest ways to 
    build a GUI application. Random module use to generate random numbers
