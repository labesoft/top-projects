# [Hangman Game in Python](https://data-flair.training/blogs/hangman-game-python-code/)
Going back to our old school days, some of the pen-paper games were always a top for
our leisure time. Hangman was one, other than some chit games, to guess words according
to the guesses determined and as soon as they lost all their wrong guesses, they were
hanged (not really, but on paper ðŸ˜‰). That is an old way, now to play Hangman. The new
advancement in technologies allows us to play hangman using our own computer also 
without any other player. How? Letâ€™s find out further

## About the project
The objective of our project is to implement the hangman game using Python. It doesn't
require any specific modules other than random and time. Python loops and functions are
enough to build this game here.

## Prerequisite
This project requires good knowledge of Python which includes defining functions and 
managing for/while loops. The functions that we use here contain arguments that are
defined in a global scope which can be further used in other functions to improve game
quality. It can also be used to provide different steps when required to execute upon
conditions by the for and while loops.

## Project Plan
First, let's check the steps to build the Hangman game in Python:

1. Importing the random and time modules.
1. Defining functions with specific global arguments
1. Implementing loops to execute the program.
1. Passing the function in the program to run.

So that is basically what we will do in this Python project. Let's start.
