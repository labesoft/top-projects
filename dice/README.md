# [Dice Rolling Simulator Python Game](https://data-flair.training/blogs/dice-rolling-simulator-python/)
## About the project

Snake and Ladders, Ludo and Checkers, are the most favorite games of all time. 
But, it feels terrible when you drop the plan of playing just because you
couldn’t find the dice. So, here is a fascinating option to give you a chance
to make something cool. Let’s build a Dice Rolling Simulator with basic
knowledge of Python.

## Prerequisite
For this game we need to continue our good coding practices, our GUI design
knowledge plus the integration of a new 3d GUI that will display the rolling
dice based on our model. The new knowledge to integrate here is to follow a
TDD process as it is still a simple application to develop.

## Project Plan
The project will develop as following:

- [ ] The 3D library integration plan
- [ ] The OO design + doc
- [ ] The unit testing plan and implementation
- [ ] The MVC implementation
- [ ] The review (code, tests, doc)
