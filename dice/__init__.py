About this Project
------------------
We all know about dice. Itâ€™s a simple cube with numbers from 1 to 6 written
on its face. But what is simulation? It is making a computer model. Thus,
a  dice simulator is a simple computer model that can roll a dice for us.

We now aim to build a dice simulator.
